# Health-Insurance-cross-sell-EDA
Exploratory data analysis on the health insurance dataset provided on Kaggle by Anmol Kumar.

# Scope of the Analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is very important and basic step that is used to understand the data and how it behaves. In the most simple terms, EDA is understanding the data with help of data visualization and descriptive statistics. I have learnt EDA and various Machine learning concepts through various courses,and through this project I have made an attempt to implement and improove my EDA and visualization knowledge.
The scope of this project is to check what features can affect the response of the potential customer. Also, this can be used to target the ideal customers.
